Expereimenting with swiss style graphic design in photoshop. Repo contains 3 seperate projects before that was outlawed by the arcade rules. See all three in the image above.


If you want to use these, you can modify the .psd files to your liking or use these independently if you want however you want. I claim these images as public domain.
